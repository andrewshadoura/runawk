Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 23 Dec 2007 20:30:05 +0200

    After lots of thoughts I switched to BSD make.  This makes some
    changes in building process, see README/INSTALLATION section for
    a brief description.

    ADDED: man page for runawk. HTML version runawk.html can also be
    generated from runawk.pod using pod2html, see Makefile.

    ADDED: -i/-I options for forcing/disabling adding /dev/stdin to
    the list of awk arguments. See man page for more information.

    A few AWK modules are installed to PREFIX/share/runawk: abs.awk,
    min.awk, max.awk and alt_assert.awk. This directory is also checked
    while searching for modules. See man page for more details.

    AWK_PROG and STDIN_FILENAME Makefile variables can be passed to make
    program to change a path to an actual AWK interpreter (/usr/bin/awk
    by default) and stdin file (/dev/stdin by default).

    Lots of improvements in documentation

    ADDED: regression tests. Run them by running 'make test' and let
    me know if somethiung fails.

    debugging output is sent stdout, not stderr

    ADDED: long synonyms for short options, --help, --version etc.

    clean-ups in Makefile

    options handling improvements

Version 0.8.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 24 Oct 2007 14:46:12 +0300

    FIXED: default stdin file should be /std/stdin, not /dev/stderr,
    I've made a typo.

Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 21 Oct 2007 17:19:46 +0300

    FIXED: return code of execvp is not analysed, i.e. when running
    an interpreter fails, runawk silently exits with zero exit status.
    Now it fails with exit status 1 and print an error to stderr.

    stdin filename defaults to "/dev/stdin"

    ROOT variable in Makefile has been renamed
    to more commonly used PREFIX

    realloc(2) is not used anymore. arrays[ARRAY_SZ] are used now.

    AWK and STDIN_FILENAME variables are removed from Makefile.
    Use CPPFLAGS for changing defaults.
