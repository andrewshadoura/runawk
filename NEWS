Version 0.10.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue, 29 Jan 2008 13:23:23 +0200

    FIXED: If AWK interpreter segfaults or killed by any other
    signal, runawk exits with exit status 0.
    Now this is fixed and runawk exits with exit status 128+SIGNAL
    just like shell does. Affected versions: all.

Version 0.10.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 23 Jan 2008 00:38:31 +0200

    ADDED: The environment variable RUNAWK_AWKPROG overrides
    the default awk interpreter which is set at compile time.
    Documentation updated accordingly.

    FIXED: unsafe use of strdup(3)

    I've copied MIT License text to code from www.opensource.org.
    Do you see any difference?

    ADDED: new trivial module pow.awk that implements function "pow"

    fix: MKMAN and MKCATPAGES make's standard variables are checked
    during installation

    In order to build runawk not in a directory you can either build
    it like this (standard way)
        cd /src/dir; make all install MAKEOBJDIR=/obj/dir
    or like this
        cd /obj/dir; make -f /src/dir/Makefile all install

    optional config.h is #included if you need it

    other minor fixes and improvements both in code and documentation

Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 23 Dec 2007 22:20:23 +0200

    I switched to BSD make. I really hate automake and its approach in
    general. I'm not expert in BSD, but their 'make' looks much
    better. But using it makes some changes in building process, see
    README/INSTALLATION section for a brief description.

    ADDED: man page for runawk. HTML version runawk.html can also be
    generated from runawk.pod using pod2html, see Makefile.

    ADDED: -i/-I options for forcing/disabling adding /dev/stdin to
    the list of awk arguments. See man page for more information.

    A few AWK modules are installed to PREFIX/share/runawk: abs.awk,
    min.awk, max.awk and alt_assert.awk. This directory is also checked
    while searching for modules. See man page for more details.

    AWK_PROG and STDIN_FILENAME Makefile variables can be passed to make
    program to change a path to an actual AWK interpreter (/usr/bin/awk
    by default) and stdin file (/dev/stdin by default).

    Lots of improvements in documentation

    ADDED: regression tests. Run them by running 'make test' and let
    me know if somethiung fails.

    debugging output is sent stdout, not stderr

    ADDED: long synonyms for short options, --help, --version etc.

    clean-ups in Makefile

    options handling improvements

======================================================================
Version 0.8.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 24 Oct 2007 14:46:12 +0300

    FIXED: default stdin file should be /std/stdin, not /dev/stderr,
    I've made a typo.

======================================================================
Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 21 Oct 2007 17:19:46 +0300

    FIXED: return code of execvp is not analysed, i.e. when running
    an interpreter fails, runawk silently exits with zero exit status.
    Now it fails with exit status 1 and print an error to stderr.

    stdin filename defaults to "/dev/stdin"

    ROOT variable in Makefile has been renamed
    to more commonly used PREFIX

    realloc(2) is not used anymore. arrays[ARRAY_SZ] are used now.

    AWK and STDIN_FILENAME variables are removed from Makefile.
    Use CPPFLAGS for changing defaults.

======================================================================
Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 22 Sep 2007 02:30:26 +0300

    First publicly available release.

    See README for a documentation
