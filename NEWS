Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 21 Oct 2007 17:19:46 +0300

 FIXED: return code of execvp is not analysed, i.e. when running
 an interpreter fails, runawk silently exits with zero exit status.
 Now it fails with exit status 1 and print an error to stderr.

 stdin filename defaults to "/dev/stdin"

 ROOT variable in Makefile has been renamed
 to more commonly used PREFIX

 realloc(2) is not used anymore. arrays[ARRAY_SZ] are used now.

 AWK and STDIN_FILENAME variables are removed from Makefile.
 Use CPPFLAGS for changing defaults.
