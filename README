                             INSTALLATION

0) BSD make is required. I name it just 'make' but its real name may
   vary on different systems.  bmake and pmake are possible names.
   NOTE: GNU make IS NOT GOOD!
   Latest sources of bmake, portable version of NetBSD make,
   is available here:
   http://freshmeat.net/projects/bmake/

   If you need to change the default building options,
   run make like this

     env [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS] make <target> [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS]

   See examples section below

1) Uncompress tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc runawk-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

2) cd runawk-X.Y.Z

3) make

4) (optional!) make installdirs

5) make install

There are a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
installation.  RunAWK's own variables (All they are at the begining of
Makefile):

 PREFIX         - where runawk is installed to            [/usr/local])
 MODULESDIR     - directory where modules are installed to
 AWK_PROG       - path to awk interpreter
 STDIN_FILENAME - path to stdin device file               [-]

BSD make's variables (most commonly used,
for all others - see make's documentation and appropriate .mk files)

 BINDIR - where runawk executable itself is installed to
 MANDIR - where manual pages are installed to

 BINOWN - runawk executable owner
 BINGRP - runawk executable group

 MANOWN - man page owner
 MANGRP - man page group

Examples:
   make installdirs install

   env CC=gcc \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lextralib \
       CFLAGS='-Werror -Wall -O2 -fomit-frame-pointers' \
       CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/pkg/include \
       BINOWN=cheusov \
       BINGRP=users \
       MANOWN=cheusov \
       MANGRP=users \
       MKCATPAGES=yes \
          make -s all installdirs install

                           MODULES

RunAWK provides lots of AWK modules ready for use. All of them are
under modules/ subdirectory. They are installed by default.
