runawk - small wrapper for AWK interpreter that impements module
system and helps to write the standalone AWK programs.

======================================================================
Documentation:

You can use runawk by beginning your script with

   #!/usr/local/bin/runawk

line or 

   #!/usr/bin/awk -f

or something like this.

------------------------------------------------------------
Modules are enabled like this

  #use "module1.awk"
  #use "module2.awk"

that is the line that specifies module name is treated as a comment line
by normal AWK interpreter and is processed by runawk especially.

Note that AWK modules can also "use" another module and so forth.
All them are collected and each one is added to the list of
arguments prepanded with -f option.
That is "#use" directive is *NOT* like #include directive in C language.
It is more like to Perl's "use" command.

Also note that modules are added to the list of arguments only once,
i.e. with no duplications.

Example:

  file prog:
     #!/usr/local/bin/runawk

     #use "A.awk"
     #use "B.awk"
     #use "E.awk"

     PROG code
     ...

  file B.awk:
     #use "A.awk"
     #use "C.awk"
     B code
     ...

  file C.awk:
     #use "A.awk"
     #use "D.awk"

     C code
     ...

  A.awk and D.awk don't contain #use directive

If you run

  runawk prog file1 file2

then actually

  awk -f A.awk -f D.awk -f C.awk -f B.awk -f E.awk -f prog -- file1 file2

command will run.

In order to pass arguments to AWK script, but the AWK interpreter, runawk
treat their arguments beginning with - sign (until normal file is found)
especially. The following command

  runawk prog2 -h -f=file -o=output file1 file2

will actually run

  awk -f prog2 -- -x -f=file -o=output file1 file2

and therefore -s, -f, -o option will be passed to ARGV/ARGC variables
together with file1 and file2. When all arguments begin with -
stdin is added to the end of argument list, that is running

  runawk prog3 --value=value

the following 

  awk -f prog3 -- --value=value -

will be run.

------------------------------------------------------------

For some reason you may prefer one AWK interpreter or another like this.

  file prog:
     #!/usr/local/bin/runawk

     #use "A.awk"
     #use "B.awk"
     #use "E.awk"

     #interp "/usr/pkg/bin/nbawk"

     PROG code
